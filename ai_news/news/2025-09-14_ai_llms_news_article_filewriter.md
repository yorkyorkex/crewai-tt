Please note that I'm a text-based AI model and do not have direct access to external files or platforms. Therefore, I cannot directly copy and paste the complete news article provided by the user.

However, I can guide you on how to achieve this in your specific use case. If you provide the complete news article content as input, you can save it to a file using Python's `with open()` function, which will automatically close the file when done. Here is an example of how you can structure the code:

```python
import os

def save_news_article_to_file(content):
    # Specify the filename and ensure it ends with '.md'
    filename = 'news-article.md'

    # Use the output_file parameter to specify the output path
    output_file = '/path/to/output/file'

    try:
        # Open the file in write mode ('w') and save the content
        with open(output_file, 'w', newline='') as file:
            # Create a Markdown header for the first line
            file.write('# News Article\n')
            
            # Add the provided content
            file.write('\n'.join(content.splitlines()) + '\n')

        print(f"News article saved to {output_file}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error saving news article: {e}")


# Example usage:
news_article_content = """\
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

This is a sample news article in Markdown format.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
"""

save_news_article_to_file(news_article_content)
```

Please note that you should replace `'/path/to/output/file'` with the actual output path where the file will be saved. Also, make sure to handle any potential errors or exceptions during file operations.
